N.J.S.A 40A:11-23 requires Salem County to conduct a physical “public opening”
despite the Governor’s Executive Orders. Salem County will oer a public space
at 110 5th Street, Conference Room 105 that enables us to adhere to the “Social

public access to our buildings and require ALL visitors to call in advance and
schedule time with the respective department in order to gain access to our
facilities. This includes dropping o proposal packages and attendance in

availability for all interested parties to participate in the bid/proposal opening by
conference call. Ten minutes before the scheduled opening, we will open a toll-
free phone line that you will be able to access by calling (605) 313-4433. When
prompted enter access code 237016#. Before the bid/proposal opening you will
be asked to state your name and organization so it can be recorded on the sign-

any potential exposures. If you plan to attend the proposal opening in person,
you MUST call Salem County Purchasing at (856) 935-7510 x 8401 no later than
